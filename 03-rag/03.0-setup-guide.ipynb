    "\n",
    "We'll start the lab by creating an Azure AI Search index in our search service, which will contain vectorized representations of our documents. The steps shown below to create the AI Search index are from the official [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-get-started-portal-import-vectors?tabs=sample-data-storage%2Cmodel-aoai%2Cconnect-data-storage)\n",

    "2. Expand \"Data Storage\" in the side menu and click on \"Containers\". \n",
