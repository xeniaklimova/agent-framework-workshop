    "\n",
    "**Context Providers** are the mechanisms you can implement to enable memory and persistent context for the agents.  They act as middleware that runs before and after every agent invocation, allowing you to inject relevant context into the conversation and extract information for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Framework provides built-in conversation history through threads, and you can serialize threads to persist them across sessions. However, these are fundamentally constrained by the LLM's context window. \n",
    "Context providers solve this by moving memory and knowledge storage outside the token-limited conversation into external systems designed specifically for information retrieval and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following tutorial, you will learn how to use **Azure AI Search** with both custom search tools and the `AzureAISearchContextProvider` (automatic context injection). Azure AI Search is excellent for grounding agents in enterprise knowledge and relevant documentation retrieval. It solves the critical challenge of ensuring agents provide accurate, source-backed answers rather than generating potentially incorrect information from the LLM's training data alone.\n"

    "> `AzureAISearchContextProvider` inherits from AF's `ContextProvider` base class. A Context Provider is a context assembly step that dynamically adds context to an agent's prompt during execution. It operates with its own allocated token budget and can maintain or modify state after each invocation. This design allows you to construct context from multiple sources that work together in sequence. By using the AF Context Provider API, you can organize different types of context separately, such as short-term (threads and responses) and long-term memory (such as Mem0 and Azure AI Search store), available tools and user profile information, and inject each as needed into the agent's context."

    "2. **Semantic Relevance** - Azure AI Search's semantic ranking automatically surfaces the most relevant results from both indexes, regardless of which one contains the best answer\n",

    "In our sample, there is no actual persistence and memory control — we're simply showcasing the control surface, which is the Context Provider API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the architecture breaks down:\n",
    "- Threads handle the conversation history and context within the current session\n",
    "- Such tools as Mem0 and Azure AI Search handle persistent state, but only because policy governs the selection, retrieval and change of that state\n",
    "\n",
    "The Context Provider API gives you the hooks to implement these policies deciding what gets stored, when it gets retrieved, how it's represented in context, and when it gets updated. Without these governance policies, you'd just have storage, not memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the [AF Context Provider Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started/context_providers) to learn about the implementation basics of other context providers, such as Mem0 for long-term memory and persistence, and Redis for high-performance state management and multi-agent coordination."
