    "#### Introduction to Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Search** is a fully managed search-as-a-service that lets you add sophisticated search capabilities to your apps without having to manage the whole search infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core capabilities:** Azure AI Search indexes your content (documents, databases, files, etc.) and provides fast, relevant search results with features like full-text search, filtering, faceting, autocomplete, and semantic search. The \"AI\" part comes from its integration with cognitive services for things like Optical Character Recognition (OCR), key phrase extraction, entity recognition, and language detection during indexing.\n",
    "- **Data sources:** You can pull data from various sources like Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, or push data directly via REST APIs. It supports many file formats including PDFs, Office documents, HTML, JSON, and plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond basic keyword search, Azure AI Search offers semantic search (understanding meaning and context), vector search for similarity matching, hybrid search combining multiple approaches, and AI enrichment to extract insights from unstructured content. You can also customize ranking, add synonyms, and support multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why are we using Azure AI Search as a context provider?\n",
    "\n",
    "It will do everything for us! \n",
    "\n",
    "Chat models face constraints on the amount of data they can accept on a request. You should use Azure AI Search because the quality of content passed to an LLM can make or break a RAG solution.\n"
