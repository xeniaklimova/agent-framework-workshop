    "### Context Providers \n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Providers** are the mechanisms you can implement to enable memory and persistent context for the agents.  They act as middleware that runs before and after every agent invocation, allowing you to inject relevant context into the conversation and extract information for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Framework provides built-in conversation history through threads, and you can serialize threads to persist them across sessions. However, these are fundamentally constrained by the LLM's context window. \n",
    "Context providers solve this by moving memory and knowledge storage outside the token-limited conversation into external systems designed specifically for information retrieval and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following tutorial, you will learn how to use **Azure AI Search** with both custom search tools and the `AzureAISearchContextProvider` (automatic context injection). Azure AI Search is excellent for grounding agents in enterprise knowledge and relevant documentation retrieval. It solves the critical challenge of ensuring agents provide accurate, source-backed answers rather than generating potentially incorrect information from the LLM's training data alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the [AF Context Provider Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started/context_providers) to learn about the implementation basics of other context providers, such as Mem0 for long-term memory and personalization, and Redis for high-performance state management and multi-agent coordination."

    "### Exercise 1 - Single agent with multiple context providers\n",
    "\n",
    "We are working with two distinct knowledge bases, each serving a different purpose for our HR Assistant agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index 1: Health Plans Documentation (Specialized)** - detailed formal documentation about two specific health plans - Northwind Health Plus Plan and Northwind Health Standard Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "This index includes detailed information on plans' formalities, specific coverage details and exclusions, eligibility requirements and enrollment procedures, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Purpose*: Specialized, technical resource for answering detailed questions about health plan specifics and comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index 2: General HR Knowledge (Context Provider)** - broad HR information about Contoso Electronics - employee benefits and plan packages overview, policies and employee handbook guidelines, wellness reimbursement programs and role descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Purpose*: Provides general HR context and handles common employee inquiries about company policies and benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create an HR Assistant agent that:\n",
    "1. Is grounded in the general HR context from Index 2 (context provider)\n",
    "2. Automatically invokes Index 1 as a custom search tool when users ask technical, specialized questions about health plan comparisons or specific plan details\n",
    "3. Combines both knowledge sources to provide comprehensive and accurate answers\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures:\n",
    "1. **Efficiency and Cost Optimization** - the specialized health plans index is significantly larger and querying it on every request would be computationally expensive, most user queries don't require this level of detail. Using it as a custom tool only when needed optimizes performance and reduces API costs.\n",
    "2. **Scalability and Maintainability** -  allows additional specialized tools to be added later without bloating the base context. Health plan documents can be updated independently, and the general HR context can be reused for different specialized agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a second index following the same process as previously in Azure portal. This will give your agent two separate knowledge sources to search from.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upload documents** from the `data/index2` folder to a new container in your storage account\n",
    "   - Create a new container\n",
    "   - Upload the files\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the second index** in Azure AI Search\n",
    "   - Follow the exact same steps you used to create the first index\n",
    "   - Use the new container as your data source\n",
    "   - Configure vectorization with your **text-embedding-3-large** deployment\n",
    "   - Give it a distinct name\n",
    "\n",
    "*Result*: You'll now have two search indexes that your agent can use as separate context providers. Note down **the name of the second index** - this is the only value you'll need to connect it to your agent.\n"

    "#### Sample overview:\n",

    "1. **`ChatAgent`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates the recommended pattern for building production-grade AI agents using AF's `ChatAgent` class.

    "2. **`async`**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `async with` statement to manage two resources: the `search_provider` (which maintains connections to Azure AI Search) and the `agent` itself (which manages its internal resources and lifecycle). This pattern ensures both are properly initialized and cleaned up, so when you exit, it automatically cleans up those resources (closing connections, releasing handles). This is critical for async operations because it guarantees cleanup happens even if errors occur, preventing resource leaks in long-running applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`run_stream`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming returns an async iterator that yields response chunks as the LLM generates them, rather than waiting for the complete response. This ensures that large responses are processed incrementally without buffering everything in memory.
