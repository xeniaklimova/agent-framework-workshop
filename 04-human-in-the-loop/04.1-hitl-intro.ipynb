    "## Introduction to Human In The Loop in Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows in the Microsoft Agent Framework allow developers to design, monitor, and control how multiple AI agents and logic components interact to complete complex tasks. They bring structure, flexibility, and transparency to agent-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to bring in control and manage agent workflows is to add human approvals. When agents require any user input, for example to approve a function call, this is referred to as a **human-in-the-loop** pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "An agent run that requires user input will complete with a response that indicates what input is required from the user instead of completing with a final answer. The caller of the agent is then responsible for getting the required input from the user and passing it back to the agent as part of a new agent run.\n"

    "### Request and Response\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recap - Message-Centric Execution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In AF, agent execution is fundamentally about the **data flow** - a workflow will keep running as long as there is data being passed. Agents don't \"call\" each other or pass control in a traditional procedural sense. Instead, they communicate through typed messages flowing between executors through edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executors** are where computation happens. When an executor emits a message, it flows along the edges to downstream executors which activate when their dependent data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents communicate with applications via different message content types (`TextContent`, `FunctionCallContent`, `FunctionApprovalRequestContent`, etc.). Messages are represented by the `ChatMessage` class and all content type classes inherit from the base `BaseContent` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed list of available content types and their usage, refer to the folowing (documentation)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/agents/running-agents?pivots=programming-language-python].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Approval Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of the message can also be used to let the application approve or disapprove some actions the agent wants to take.\n",
    "**User Approval Content** type enables human-in-the-loop approvals within the standard message flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approval mechanism intercepts the normal tool invocation flow, pausing execution until human approval is granted or denied:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/reqresp.png\" alt=\"User Approval Content Type\" style=\"width:70%; height:40%; margin:20px auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When a ChatAgent needs to invoke a Tool that requires approval:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Inference**: The ChatAgent uses the Model to make an inference and determines it needs to invoke the Tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Approval Request**: Before executing, the Tool sends a request back to the ChatAgent, which surfaces to the Application as `FunctionApprovalRequestContent` (a special ChatMessage content type).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Response**: The Application presents this approval request to the user, who responds (Yes/No). This response is sent back to the ChatAgent as `FunctionApprovalResponseContent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution**: Once the ChatAgent receives approval, the Tool executes and returns its result to the ChatAgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Inference**: The Model makes another inference using the Tool's result to generate a natural language response as `TextContent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Complete Response**: The Application receives both the `FunctionResultContent` (the raw tool output) and the `TextContent` (the Model's interpretation of that result).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Approval Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "User approvals are necessary in many cases, especially when tool execution involves external resources or has side effects. Common scenarios include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Irreversible operations**: Data deletion, financial transactions, resource provisioning\n",
    "- **External system access**: Database modifications, API calls, file system operations\n",
    "- **Security-sensitive actions**: Credential access, permission changes, privileged operations\n",
    "\n",
    "When a tool requires approval, the agent pauses execution and transfers control to the application. The agent preserves its state (conversation history, pending actions, context) and waits for the application's decision before proceeding. This mechanism ensures critical operations require explicit human authorization while maintaining the agent's execution context for immediate resumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "As covered in Chapter 1, **Agent Middleware** provides a general-purpose mechanism for intercepting agent interactions at three levels: agent (intercepts entire agent execution), function (intercepts individual tool invocations), and chat (intercepts LLM calls). You can think of the process of user approval during tool invocation as *tool middleware*. "
